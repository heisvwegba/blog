After considering complex options, I decided to build a fast, minimal static blog from scratch using standard HTML, CSS and Eleventy(_11ty_).

### Why Eleventy?

I wanted a setup that gives me full control over my CSS while allowing me to write posts in plain Markdown. Eleventy fits this perfectly:

* **Flexible templating:** I can reuse my existing HTML structures with Nunjucks templates.
* **Zero extra JavaScript overhead:** It outputs clean, static HTML files.
* **Fast local preview:** Changes compile almost instantly as I write.


### Key Technical Decisions

* **Custom CSS:** Built using native Flexbox layouts, CSS variables, and clean font stacks (Berlin Sans, Iosevka Charon and Tinos).
* **Minimal Dependencies:** Uses minimal build configuration with plain Markdown parsing.
* **Date Parsing:** Custom Node.js filters format publication dates smoothly across timezones.


### What's Next?

Now that the foundation is live, I'll be sharing notes on software projects, random thoughts and continuous learning.
